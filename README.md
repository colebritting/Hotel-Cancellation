# Hotel-Cancellation

Using data on hotel cancellations, I used Python to create machine learning models to try and predict if a customer will cancel their hotel reservation. I first got a base understanding of the data, used visualizations to further dive into what features may have an affect on cancellation, perpared the data for our models, and then created the models. I focused on K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVC to find out which was the most accurate.
